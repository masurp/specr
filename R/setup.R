#' Specifying analytical decisions in a specification setup
#'
#' @description Creates all possible specifications as a combination of
#'    different dependent and independent variables, model types, control
#'    variables, potential subset analyses, as well as potentially other
#'    analytic choices. This function represents the first step in the
#'    analytic framework implemented in the package \code{specr}. The resulting
#'    class \code{specr.setup} then needs to be passed to the core function of
#'    the package called \code{specr()}, which fits the specified models across
#'    all specifications.
#'
#' @param data The data set that should be used for the analysis
#' @param y A vector denoting the dependent variables
#' @param x A vector denoting independent variables
#' @param model A vector denoting the model(s) that should be estimated.
#' @param subsets Specification of potential subsets/groups as list.  There are two ways
#'    in which these can be specified that both start from the assumption that the
#'    "grouping" variable is in the data set. The simplest way is to provide a named
#'    vector within the list, whose name is the variable that should be used for
#'    subsetting and whose values are the values that reflect the subsets (e.g.,
#'    `list(group2 = c("female", "male")`). In this case, the specifications will
#'    includes "all", "only female" and "only male". Alternatively, you can also use
#'    the `unique` function to extract that vector directly from the data set
#'    (e.g., `list(group2 = unique(example_data$group2`). Both approaches lead to the
#'    same result. The former, however, has the advantages that one can also remove some of the
#'    subgroups (e.g. `list(group2 = c("female")`). In this case, the specifications
#'    will include "all" (no subset) and "only females". See examples for more details.
#' @param controls A vector of the control variables that should be included.
#'    Defaults to NULL.
#' @param add_to_formula A string specifying aspects that should always be
#'    included in the formula (e.g. a constant covariate, random effect structures...)
#' @param fun1 A function that extracts the parameters of interest from the
#'    fitted models. Defaults to [tidy][broom::broom-package], which works
#'    with a large range of different models.
#' @param fun2 A function that extracts fit indices of interest from the models.
#'    Defaults to [glance][broom::broom-package], which works with a large range of
#'    different models. Note: Different models result in different fit indices. Thus,
#'    if you use different models within one specification curve analysis, this may not
#'    work. In this case, you can simply set `fun2 = NULL` to not extract any fit indices.
#' @param simplify Logical value indicating what type of combinations between
#'    control variables should be included in the specification. If FALSE (default),
#'    all combinations between the provided variables are created (none, each
#'    individually, each combination between each variable, all variables). If
#'    TRUE, only no covariates, each individually, and all covariates are included
#'    as specifications (akin to the default in specr version 0.2.1).
#'
#' @return An object of class \code{specr.setup} which includes all possible
#'    specifications based on combinations of the analytic choices. The
#'    resulting list includes a specification tibble, the data set, and additional
#'    information about the universe of specifications. Use
#'    \code{methods(class = "specr.setup")} for an overview on available methods.
#'
#' @details Empirical results are often contingent on analytical decisions that
#'    are equally defensible, often arbitrary, and motivated by different reasons.
#'    This decisions may introduce bias or at least variability. To this end,
#'    specification curve analyses  (Simonsohn et al., 2020) or multiverse
#'    analyses (Steegen et al., 2016) refer to identifying the set of
#'    theoretically justified, statistically valid (and potentially also non-redundant
#'    specifications, fitting the "multiverse" of models represented by these
#'    specifications and extract relevant parameters often to display the results
#'    graphically as a so-called specification curve. This allows readers to
#'    identify consequential specifications decisions and how they affect the results
#'    or parameter of interest.
#'
#'    \bold{Use of this function}
#'
#'    A general overview is provided in the vignettes \code{vignette("specr")}.
#'    It is assumed that you want to estimate the relationship between two variables
#'    (\code{x} and \code{y}). What varies may be what variables should be used for
#'    \code{x} and \code{y}, what model should be used to estimate the relationship,
#'    whether the relationship should be estimated for certain subsets, and whether
#'    different combinations of control variables should be included. This
#'    allows to (re)produce almost any analytical decision imaginable. See examples
#'    below for how a number of typical analytical decision can be implemented.
#'    Afterwards you pass the resulting object of a class \code{specr.setup} to the
#'    function \code{specr()} to run the specification curve analysis.
#'
#'    Note, the resulting class of \code{specr.setup} allows to use generic functions.
#'    Use \code{methods(class = "specr.setup")} for an overview on available methods and
#'    e.g., \code{?summary.specr.setup} to view the dedicated help page.
