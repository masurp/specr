      Core functions of the package that allow to a) setup all specifications and b) then fit models across all specifications
    contents:
      - setup
      - specr
  - title: "Summarize results"
    desc: >
      Both functions above create S3 classes that can be investigated with the generic summary function and transformed to data frames.
    contents:
      - summary.specr.setup
      - summary.specr.object
  - title: "Plot results"
    desc: >
      After running specr(), the resulting S3 class object can be passed to the generic plot function to visualize the results.
