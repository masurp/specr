### News

- (5 January 2022): specr version 0.3.0 is available via github. This is a major update with several new features and functions:
    - `setup_specs()` becomes `setup()` and thereby allows to completely setup all specifications before actually estimating the models.
    - `run_specs()` becomes `specr()` and wraps around `setup()` to estimate all models.
    - Both `setup()` and `specr()` produce S3 classes that can be investigated using generic function such as `summary()` or `plot()`.
    - For more information about these changes, see further below.

- (4 December 2020): specr development version 0.2.2 is available via github. Mostly minor updates and bug fixes.
    - All plotting functions allow to choose which parameter to plot.
    - More complete results based on `broom::tidy()` and `broom::glance()`.

- (25 May 2020): specr version 0.2.1 has been released on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/specr/index.html).

### What is specr?

The goal of specr is to facilitate specification curve analyses (Simonsohn, Simmons & Nelson, 2019; also known as multiverse analyses, see Steegen, Tuerlinckx, Gelman & Vanpaemel, 2016). It can be used to investigate how different (theoretically plausible) analytical choices affect outcome statistics within the universe of one single data set. 

It provides functions to setup, run, evaluate, and plot the multiverse of specifications. A simple example of how to use specr is provided below. For more information about the various functions and specific use cases, visit the [documentation](https://masurp.github.io/specr/index.html). 

There are also some vignettes that exemplify and explain specific aspects and functions of the package:

- [Getting started](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/specr.html): A comprehensive example. This vignette illustrates the major functions of the package. 
- [Customizing plots](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/custom-plot.html): This vignette exemplifies various ways to plot the specification curve. 
- [Investigating variance in the specification curve](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/decompose_var.html): Investigating variance components of the specification curve.
- [Incorporating structural equation modeling](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/measurement_models.html): This vignette exemplifies how to include latent measurement models and estimate structural equations models using `lavaan`. 
- [Incorparting multilevel modeling](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/random_effects.html): This vignette exemplifies how to include random effects and estimate multilevel models using `lme4`.


### Disclaimer

We do see a lot of value in investigating how analytical choices affect a statistical outcome of interest. However, we strongly caution against using `specr` as a tool to somehow arrive at a better estimate. Running a specification curve analysis does not make your findings any more reliable, valid or generalizable than a single analysis. The method is only meant to inform about the effects of analytical choices on results, and not a better way to estimate a correlation or effect.

### Installation

Install specr from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("specr")  # version 0.2.1
```

Or install the most recent development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("masurp/specr")  # version 0.3.0
```

### Usage

Using `specr` is comparatively simple. The two main function are `setup()`, in which analytic choices are specified as arguments, and `specr()`, which fits the models across all specifications. The latter creates a class called "specr.object", which can be summarized and plotted with generic function such as `summary` or `plot`. 

```{r, message=F, warning = F, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
# Load package ----
library(specr)

# Setup Specifications ----
specs <- setup(data = example_data, 
               y = c("y1", "y2"), 
               x = c("x1", "x2"), 
               model = c("lm"), 
               distinct(example_data, group1),
               distinct(example_data, group2),
               controls = c("c1", "c2"))

# Run Specification Curve Analysis ----
results <- specr(specs, workers = 1)

# Plot Specification Curve ----
plot(results)
```
