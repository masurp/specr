## Overview

The goal of specr is to facilitate specification curve analyses as described by Simonson, Simmons & Nelson (2019). It can be used to investigate how different (e.g., theoretical defensible) analytical choices affect outcome statistics within the universe of one single data set. 

It provides functions to setup, run, evaluate, and plot the multiverse of specifications. A simple usage example is provided below. For more information about the various functions and specific use cases, visit the [documentation](https://masurp.github.io/specr/index.html). 

For a more comprehensive examples and vignettes on how to use the various functions of the package, check out the following pages:

- [Getting started](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/specr.html): A comprehensive example. This vignette illustrates the major functions of the package. 
- [Customizing specification curve plots](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/custom-plot.html): This vignette exemplifies various ways to plot the specification curve. 
- [Decomposing the variance of the specification curve](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/decompose_var.html): An example of how to investigate variance components of the specification curve.
- [Visualizing progress during estimation](https://masurp.github.io/specr/articles/progress.html): This vignette explains how to create a customizable progress bar for longer computations.

## Disclaimer

We do see a lot of value in investigating how analytical choices affect a statistical outcome of interest. However, we strongly caution against using `specr` as a tool to somehow arrive at a better estimate. Running a specification curve analysis does not make your findings any more reliable, valid or generalizable than a single analyis. The method is only meant to inform about the effects of analytical choices on results, and not a better way to estimate a correlation or effect.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("masurp/specr")
```

## Simple example

Using `specr` is comparatively simple. The main function is `run_specs()` in which analytical choices are specified as arguments. The function `plot_specs()` can then be used to visualize the results.

```{r, message=F, warning = F, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
library(specr)

# Run specs
results <- run_specs(df = example_data, 
                     y = c("y1", "y2"), 
                     x = c("x1", "x2"), 
                     model = c("lm"), 
                     controls = c("c1", "c2"), 
                     subsets = list(group1 = unique(example_data$group1),
                                    group2 = unique(example_data$group2)))
# Result frame
head(results)

# Plot
plot_specs(results, choices = c("x", "y", "controls", "subsets"))
```

## How to cite this package

Developing and maintaining open source software is an important yet often underappreciated contribution to scientific progress. Thus, whenever you are using open source software (or software in general), please make sure to cite it appropriately so that developers get credit for their work.

When using `specr`, please cite it as follows:

```{r}
citation("specr")
```
